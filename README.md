# Object-Oriented Programming

This is a repository that contains the different code examples and practice in the Object-Oriented Programming course. The examples are written in Python, C++, and Java.

## Structure

The repository is structured as follows:

```
csc302_codes/
├── python/
│ ├── example1.py
│ ├── example2.py
│ └── ...
├── cpp/
│ ├── example1.cpp
│ ├── example2.cpp
│ └── ...
└── java/
├── Example1.java
├── Example2.java
└── ...
```


- The `python` directory contains Python code examples.
- The `cpp` directory contains C++ code examples.
- The `java` directory contains Java code examples.

Feel free to explore the different directories and files to access the code examples and practice materials.

## Usage

You can clone the repository using the following command:

```
git clone https://github.com/ochudi/csc302_codes.git
```

Once cloned, you can navigate to the specific language directories (`python`, `cpp`, `java`) to find the relevant code examples. Each example file can be opened and executed in the corresponding language's development environment.
